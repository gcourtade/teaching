    "# NMR Exercise - Titration of CBM14 with GlcNAc3\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "Before starting this exercise, you will need to install the following software:\n",
    "* CARA: http://www.cara.nmr-software.org/downloads/ (for Windows, version 1.5.5 is the most stable)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Jupyter Notebook, and it is a way to run python code in an interactive way. To execute the code in each cell, just press click `►|Run` on the toolbar above or use the keyboard: `Shift + Enter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will learn how to calculate the dissociation constant ($K_d$) for a ligand-protein complex, from a series of NMR spectra (15N-HSQC) recorded at different ligand concentrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The protein:** Carbohydrate-Binding Module 14 (CBM14) from Human macrophage chitotriosidase (PDB ID: 6SO0) [1,2]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The ligand:** Chitotriose, a chitin trisaccharide (GlcNAc3)\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](images/prot-lig2.png?2)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is that by the end of the exercise you should be able to answer the following questions:\n",
    "* How can we extract chemical shift perturbations (dependent varialbe) from a titration series (independent variable)?\n",
    "* Which CBM14 amino acids interact with GlcNAc3? \n",
    "* What is the $K_d$ of the interaction?\n",
    "* How can we check if the $K_d$ we obtained is valid?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kd from chemical shift perturbations\n",
    "We assume a a two-state process where a ligand ($L$) and protein ($P$) interact to form a complex ($PL$).\n",
    "![image](images/2state.png?4)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are at $[L]=0 mM$, $[P]$=total protein concentration and $[PL]=0 mM$ and measure the chemical shift of a peak in the 15N-HSQC spectrum, its coordinates would be ($\\delta$$H_{0mM}$, $\\delta$$N_{0mM}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we add some ligand $[L]=0.5 mM$ and we are on a fast-exchange regime, the chemical shift of the peak will change to new coordinates ($\\delta$$H_{0.5mM}$, $\\delta$$N_{0.5mM}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](images/csp2.png?1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can calculate the combined chemical shift perturbation of the peak at $L=0.5 mM$ by the using Pythagoras equation:\n",
    "## $\\Delta \\delta_{comb} = \\sqrt{(\\Delta \\delta H)^2 + (\\frac{\\Delta \\delta N}{R_{scale}})^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta \\delta H = \\delta H_{0.5mM} - \\delta H_{0mM}$, $\\Delta \\delta N = \\delta N_{0.5mM} - \\delta N_{0mM}$ and $R_{scale}=6.5$ [3]. At each titration point, we repeat this process to obtain $\\Delta \\delta_{comb}$ for each $[L]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can fit the following equation to the data by varying the parameters $K_d$ and $Q_{max}$ (equal to $\\Delta \\delta_{comb}$ at saturation).\n",
    "\n",
    "## $\\Delta \\delta_{comb}  = Q_{max} \\frac{ [P] + [L] + K_d \\pm \\sqrt{([P]+[L]+K_d)^2 -4[P][L]} }{2[P]}$\n",
    "\n",
    "See https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2012/10/25/1208822109.DCSupplemental/pnas.201208822SI.pdf if you are interested in how this equation is derived."

    "## Step 1 - Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will open CARA and load a project where we have a finished sequence-specific chemical shift assignment and 15N-HSQC spectra for our titration series.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open CARA\n",
    "2. `File > Open` and choose the file `cbm14_GlcNAc3.cara`\n",
    "![image.png](images/cara1.png)\n",
    "3. Click on `Systems` and on the `Ass` column to see the sorted NMR assignments for the protein.\n",
    "![image.png](images/cara2.png)\n",
    "4. Click on `Spectra` to see a list of the available spectra. As you see here, we only have 15N-HSQCs, each one for every $[L]$ in the titration.\n",
    "\n",
    "| experiment | $[L]$ |\n",
    "|------|---|\n",
    "|15N-HSQC_106 |   0 mM |\n",
    "|15N-HSQC_115  |  1.0 mM |\n",
    "|15N-HSQC_124  |  6.3 mM |\n",
    "|15N-HSQC_130  |  17.1 mM |\n",
    "|15N-HSQC_133  |  25.0 mM |\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Go ahead and open `15N-HSQC_106` by right-clicking on it and choosing `Open Polyscope...`\n",
    "![image.png](images/cara4.png)\n",
    "![image.png](images/cara5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Whoa, that looks messy! We need to reduce the contour levels. You can do this by clicking `Plane > Set Contour Parameters...`. Set the parameters `Factor: 1.4, Threshold: 45000 and Option:Both` and click `OK`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Much better, you can also play around with different `Threshold` and `Factor` values to see how they affect the appearence of the spectrum. Now we can zoom in a region by simulatenously holding down `Ctrl+Shift` while clicking-and-dragging with the left-button of the mouse. If you click one of the peaks you will see the 1D $^{15}N$ projection as the y-axis and the 1D $^1 H$ projection as the x-axis. In the status bar below, you can read off the corresponding chemical shifts for both dimensions. You will notice the small crosses `+` on the peaks. This should the center of the peak and (since this chemical shift assignment has already been done for us) they are labeled with the atoms in the amino acid that give rise to this signal.\n",
    "![image.png](images/cara6.png)\n",
    "8. If we zoom even more, we can see the contours of the peaks. This is very useful for detecting small changes in chemical shifts, as we will do later. If you want to move around you can use minimap in the bottom-eft corner of the window or use the keyboard: `Ctrl+Arrow keys` move the region a small distance, `Page Up` and `Page Down` move up and down by one expansion, `Ctrl+Page Up` and `Ctrl+Page Down` move left and right by one expansion. You can change the size of the zoomed area by using `Ctrl+Shift+Arrow keys`. This will enlarge or shrink your selected window vertically or horizontally.To zoom out again, right-click somewhere on the spectrum and select `Fit Window` or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Home`.\n",
    "![image.png](images/cara7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you are comfortable with moving around, zooming in and out of spectra and changing contour levels before proceeding to Step 2."
