    "Before starting this exercise, you will need to do the following:\n",
    "* Download and execute CARA: http://www.cara.nmr-software.org/downloads/ (for Windows, version 1.5.5 is the most stable)\n",

    "This is a Jupyter Notebook, and it is a way to run Python code in an interactive way. To execute the code in each cell, just press click `►|Run` on the toolbar above or use the keyboard: `Shift + Enter`. \n",
